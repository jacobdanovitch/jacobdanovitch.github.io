Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a graduate student in Machine Learning at <a href="http://mila.quebec/en" class="btn btn--icon btn--inverse" style="width: 5rem"><i class="fac fa-mila fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Mila</a> and data science intern at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msai/" class="btn btn--icon btn--inverse"><img class="icon--custom" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Microsoft_logo.svg" style="transform: translate(-1px, -1px);"> MSAI</a>. 

I completed my undergraduate studies in the honors computer science program at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, where I worked with the wonderful Professor [Majid Komeili](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~majidkomeili/) and TA'd for courses like Introduction to Web Development and [Storytelling with Data](http://www.davidmckie.com/professional-skills-data-storytelling-33310-jour-4401-a-2/).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on search and exploration in specialized domains as part of the [Complex Data Lab](https://complexdatalabmcgill.github.io/), where I'm supervised by Professor [Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/). I also work on personalized search with MSAI. I'm particularly interested in the following topics:

* Information retrieval
  * Exploratory/interactive search
  * Entity-oriented IR
  * Personalization
* Information extraction
  * Low-resource NER
  * Knowledge graph construction from text
* Legal NLP/IR

## Updates

* **April 2021**: Our work, [The Surprising Performance of Simple Baselines for Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06952), was presented at WWW 2021.
* **November 2020**: Our short paper [Detecting Informative COVID-19 Tweets by Attending over Linked Documents](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.wnut-1.63/) appeared in the W-NUT workshop at EMNLP 2020.
* **September 2020**: I wrote a [tutorial](https://guide.allennlp.org/document-ranking) on document ranking with [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/).
* **May 12, 2020:** Here are the results of my graduate school applications as well as some supporting materials, for anyone who feels unsure about the process like I did. [(repo)](https://github.com/jacobdanovitch/Graduate-Applications)
* **2019**:
  * **August**: My [work](/publications/twtc), <i style="font-style: italic">Trouble with the Curve: Predicting Future MLB Players Using Scouting Reports</i>, was a finalist in the reproducible research competition at the the [2019 Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/).
  * **July**: I completed my second internship at Microsoft (MSAI), using deep learning to extract meeting suggestions from Outlook emails.This was part of a larger project, for which a patent is pending.
